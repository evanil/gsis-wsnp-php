# GSIS WSNP PHP Client

gsis-wsnp-php is a sample PHP client for access to the web service for legal entities' details offered by Greece's Ministry of Finance General Secretariat of Information Systems.

The user provides the script with the legal entity's VAT Number, and it returns the details offered by the web service, like the company's name, its address, date of registration e.t.c.

As it was made for illustrative purposes, it doesn't pay any attention in formatting the output, or checking for the VAT Number's validity. Nevertheless, it implements some error handling, showing the error if it occurs.
